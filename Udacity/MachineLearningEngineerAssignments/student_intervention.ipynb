    "The model that I choose as the best is the logistic regression model. This model is choosen as the best model due to it having the best predictive accuarcy of the testing set, along with having reasonable prediction time. The prediction times of all the models were reasonable. However, the F1 score which is the number of correct positives or precision and the number of correct negatives or recall weighted varied between the models. Stochastic gradient descent obtained a decent score on the training set of size 100. However, increasing the size of training set caused a weird reaction the score dropped to a unreasonable value. Consequently the same event happened on the testing set. Logistic regression the score on the training set decreased with the size of the training set increasing. However, the score on the testing set increased with the size of the training set increasing. This showed that with increasing model complexity the generalization of the model on the testing set is better (only up to the point we can see which is 300 training points). The score the Gaussian Navie Bayes classifier on the training set continued to decrease with the increasing size of the training set. However, the score on the testing set varied, there was a decrease then an increase. So the score of Naive Bayes was taken as unstable. Thus logistic regression was choosen as the best model."

    "Linear models the target value or prediction value is predicted to be a linear combination of the input variables. The input variables are the features of the data. Such as age gender etc. The features are assigned weights. Feature x_0 is always assigned the value 1. Then using these features and weights that are assigned to the features we obtain the linear combination that is used for prediction. Given a training set of data we attempt to fit a line to the data that minimizes a cost function. In terms of linear regression the cost function is a squared error function. This is the error or the predicted minus the actual value squared.\n",
